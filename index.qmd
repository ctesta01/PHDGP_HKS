I want to acknowledge what an excellent team of instructors we had.

Nancy Krieger, Professor of Social Epidemiology and American Cancer Society
Clinical Research Professor in the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences,
Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and also Director of the HSPH
Interdisciplinary Concentration on Women, Gender, and Health, has been the
principle investigator for the Population Health Disparities Geocoding Projects.

Jarvis Chen (he/him) is a social epidemiologist and Lecturer in Social and
Behavioral Sciences at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and
Associate Director of the PhD in Population Health Sciences Program in Harvard
University’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

Pam Waterman has been project director for Dr. Krieger for over 20 years and
along with Nancy and Jarvis contributed to the original Population Health
Disparities Geocoding Project (PHDGP).

And then we had the help of five terrific PhD students, Enjoli Hall, Dena
Javadi, Justin Morgan, Tamara Rushovich, and Sudipta Saha. These students all
contributed unique perspectives to our training ranging from their focuses on
urban planning, the political and economic determinants of health, to their
experiences with community engaged research, social epidemiology, and
statistical modeling expertise.

These trainings were conducted over two four-day workshops offered in June and 
July of 2022. 

We invited 75 workshop attendants from diverse backgrounds including: academia
including researchers, professors, and students, public health departments, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, non-profits, policy think-tanks,
advocacy groups, and more. 

Before we go on further, I want to emphasize that we offered these workshops
completely free of cost to participants, as funded through the American Cancer
Society Clinical Research Professor award to Nancy Krieger.

## The Original PHDGP

<center>
<img src="images/01_background/PHDGP1.png" height='600px'>
</center>

:::{.notes}
The techniques involved in using geographic data in health analyses have come a
long way, both in part due to the work by Nancy Krieger in the original Public
Health Disparities Geocoding Project, and due to maturation of statistical
techniques and geographic information systems (or GIS) software. 

The original PHDGP was born out of Nancy's prior work analyzing Cancer Registry
data in relation to residential addresses. She was an early pioneer in this
field, literally geocoding addresses to census tracts by hand, but certainly not
_the_ first. 

The first incarnation of PHDGP aimed not just to inform public health practitioners
as to how to go about their work assessing, documenting, and combatting health disparities, but 
to also ask the question:  at what geographic level, and using what social variables, 
are health disparities best understood?  That work culminated in recommendations to 
focus health disparities research in the US at the Census Tract level and to use 
the proportion of households under the federal poverty line as defined by cutpoints
ranging from 0-5%, 5-10%, 10-20%, and 20% and above. 
::: 

## Origins of the Ideas

<center>
<img src="images/01_background/Origins.png" height='600px'>
</center>

:::{.notes}
Projects tying the health of the people to their geographical conditions have
their roots in the earliest examples of epidemiological studies. 

This kind of work is only made possible through use of geographic data describing
the population — including cadastral maps and Census data tables. 

In 1840, Louis-René Villermé studied the living and working conditions of
factory workers in various industries. He found that poor living and working
conditions were directly correlated with higher mortality rates.  This was, of
course, contrary to the prevalent theories of disease distribution at the time, 
which included miasma theory (literally connoting "bad air"), moral failures and
behavior of the poor, and divine punishment. 
:::

## Health Equity

<center>
<img src="images/01_background/injustice.png" height='600px'>
</center>


:::{.notes}
Health equity, one of the central goals of Public Health, refers to a conditions
in which everyone has a fair and just opportunity to be as healthy as possible. 

Unfortunately we live in a world where today there are inequities in health that
are unfair, unjust and preventable.

These inequitable conditions have been created by a long history of
discrimination and marginalization. Highlighted here are the detectable effects
of Jim Crow laws and historical redlining which kept People of Color from
housing in more White, affluent neighborhoods across the United States and
served to concentrate poverty and People of Color in areas that were given lower
grades as a result of their proximity to industrial sources of pollution, less
than ideal living conditions, and other characteristics that were perceived as
undesirable.
:::

## Health Justice 

<center>
<img src="images/01_background/health_justice_vs_equity.png" height='600px'>
</center>

:::{.notes}
Similar, but distinct to the concept of health equity is the concept of health justice.

Health justice is an approach to public health that seeks
to eliminate health disparities and achieve equity by dismantling systems of
discrimination, oppression, and marginalization that contribute to poor health
outcomes. 

Health justice emphasizes the importance of addressing the root causes of health
inequities and redistributing power away from unjust systems to ensure that all
individuals and communities have access to the resources, opportunities, and
conditions necessary to achieve optimal health and well-being.

This means challenging and and dismantling institutional and structural barriers
that perpetuate health disparities, including racism, gender and sexuality based
discrimination, ableism, weight stigma, ageism, and others.

In particular, while "Health Equity" has become a bit of a trendy term popularly
invoked to garner support for varied causes, the popularity of "Health Justice,"
which directly asks from whom power must be wrested and how resources must be
redistributed to create equitable conditions, has, in contrast, lagged.

## Ecosocial Theory 

<center>
<img src="images/01_background/ecosocial_theory.png" height='600px'>
</center>

:::{.notes}
With that, I want to introduce the Ecosocial Theory of Disease Distribution
which is a framework for understanding health disparities that Nancy Krieger has
been developing for the past several decades.

Ecosocial theory specifically asks us to identify how individuals physically and
biologically embody the harms, disadvantages and injustices done unto them by
systems of oppression that exist as a result of contemporary political economy
across the life-course and across levels of society.

Moreover, this framework calls into focus that the accountability of systems of
power and individuals' agency within them are foundational causal factors in the
explanation of the inequitable distribution of disease.

:::{.notes}

analysis techniques and methods that we taught in our trainings.

## Geocoding

<center>
<img src="images/01_background/geocoding.png" height='600px'>
</center>

:::{.notes}
It's in the name:  Geocoding — so what is it? 

Geocoding refers to the process by which we link health records or really 
any kind of records that exist in a dataset to geographic entities. 

This is such an incredibly powerful technique because in health systems data
entry is often a pain-point: Many doctors complain about how entering data into
the Electronic Medical Record means that's often time they spend typing instead of 
facing the patient and actually seeing them eye-to-eye. 

One field that huge numbers of databases and data systems routinely collect is 
individuals' residential addresses. With that information, we can use services like
Google Maps, ArcGIS, and the Census Geocoder to convert those into latitude and longitude
locations that can then be easily linked to geographic areas.

Area-Based Social Metrics (ABSMs) are quantitative measures that capture and
represent the social, economic, and demographic characteristics of a specific
geographic area or community.

Some common ABSMs include: 

  - Socioeconomic status, such as income, education, employment, poverty, and
  racialized economic segregation (which I'll talk about a bit more momentarily).
  - Demographic characteristics including age, gender, and racial/ethnic breakdowns
  - Housing and living conditions; 
  - Access to healthcare services including density of healthcare facilities and insurance
  coverage
  - Environmental factors like air and water quality, access to green spaces, and environmental
  hazards

## The Index of Concentration at the Extremes

The Index of Concentration at the Extremes
(ICE) measures the extent to which a population
in a specified area is concentrated into best-off

distribution.<br><br></span>

The ICE was introduced into the sociological
literature by Massey in 2001 to measure
economic polarization.<br><br>
</span>

<span style='font-size: 22px;'>

economic segregation.

What I'd like you to take away from this is that the geographic level 
at which data are analyzed can literally center or hide the experiences of 
historically marginalized populations — especially People of Color. 

In these figures, one can see that changing the boundaries used 
from counties to congressional districts and states means that poor Black and
Hispanic People, poor American Indian and Alaska Native people are 
made invisible.

:::{.notes}
In fact, in geography and spatial statistics, this problem is well understood 
and comes in two flavors: 

The modifiable areal unit problem states that if one chooses to change what 
boundaries are used, they can change what story the data tell — and of course this 
is well understood by those who work in the gerrymandering space as one example. 

Another flavor of this dimension to spatial data analysis is the ecological
fallacy. The ecological fallacy is the mistaken idea that correlations drawn at
a geographically aggregate level can be applied to smaller geographical levels, 
particularly the individual level.

An easy to understand example of this is what while states that are more wealthy
tend to vote more democratically, in many states individuals with higher income
tend to vote more conservatively, demonstrating the principle that correlations
drawn at the state level can't be assumed to hold at the individual level.

The relevance to the figure on the right is that we can imagine collapsing each
of these strata of observations into an average for each strata, which if we
perform a regression analysis on, we would see the decreasing relationship between X and Y.  On
the other hand, if we are able to analyze the data within strata at the
individual data-point level, we see a different, increasing relationship. This
is something that can happen when we aggregate observations up to an area-level
and draw correlations, so it's important to be mindful of the potential for this
to happen.

Now that we've talked a little bit about Area Based Social Metrics and some of
the points where particular care is needed when using them, let's talk about an

:::{.notes}
I find that there's three common reactions when I introduce tidycensus: 

  - "wow, I can't wait to start using this!" 
  
  - "why should I bother with doing this in code when I can just download the data and 
  shapefiles and do it in GIS?" 
  
  - "i'm still a bit overwhelmed and not sure where to start" 
  
I'd like to address each of these — 

So for those who can't wait to get started integrating Census measures into their
work, I'll be explaining some critical methodological considerations in a moment, 
especially around taking into account age-effects and statistical noise. 

For those who are asking what's better about using tidycensus than using a more
traditional GIS (or geographical information systems) based approach — I think
the answer lies in reproducibility. One of the unfortunate aspects of much of
GIS software  is that its point-and-click interface makes reproducing results
relatively challenging and often instructions for recreating a figure aren't
written down, rather remaining tacit knowledge for only the GIS analysts working
on a given project. 

Instead, by harnessing the power of modern programming
languages to interface with GIS, we can make our work more readily reproducible,
meaning that concerned parties including the populations whose data are being
analyzed, can more readily engage with the scientific results and methods being
employed.

Finally, I'll talk a bit later about our training manual that's available free
and online that, among other things, teaches users in step-by-step detail how to
get started with tidycensus to retrieve Census data pertaining to the ICE for
racialized economic segregation, poverty rates, and age, racial/ethnic, and
income distributions.

</div>
:::

:::{.notes}
People run into two incredibly common problems with maps of health outcomes: 
The first being the failure to use a denominator so we often can't differentiate
what are the effects of population distribution vs. other factors, and the second 
is failure to adjust for important variations in age distribution. 

In a setting like the greater Boston area, one can immediately see why this would be
so important!  We have so many census tracts that are dominated by college and
university dormitories where the median age is just slightly over 20.  If we 
were looking at, for example, COVID-19 mortality rates by census tract, it should
be no surprise that we'd see very low mortality rates in such census tracts given that
higher age is one of the single biggest contributors to COVID-19 mortality risk. 

So we have to do something about that before we let our audiences loose on maps
where area level rates are visualized. The appropriate choice is to age
standardize the rates shown in the map. This is done by re-weighting the
age-strata-specific rates according to the age-breakdown of an agreed-upon
standardized reference population.

I'll show you how this works in the next few slides, but I want to point out specifically
the first column from this table from SEER or the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 
program from NIH. 
:::

## Aggregate Methods

<img src="images/02_methods/poverty_aggregate_method.png" style='position: absolute;' height='500px'>

:::{.fragment}
<img src="images/02_methods/age_standardization_example.png" style='position: absolute;' height='600px'>

:::{.notes}
In the figure on the left is shown the areas with the highest poverty rates in red where 20-100% 
of households are in poverty, and in the lightest shade are households in the lowest poverty rate
areas, where less than 5% of households are under the federal poverty line. 

A typical health disparities research question might be what is the ratio of
premature mortality rates in the highest poverty areas to the lowest poverty
areas. And here premature mortality is defined as death before the age of 65. 

In the simplest method, we can sum up the numbers of premature deaths in the census
tracts from each poverty level, the amount of person-time during which these observations
could have occurred (i.e., the number of people who could have died multiplied by the duration of observation-time), and we could calculate rates of premature mortality per 100,000 person-years 
as a crude rate. 

But this wouldn't account for if there's a systematic difference in age between the poverty
levels — it could happen that some of these poverty levels are younger or older than the rest, 
potentially affecting what we'd see in the crude rates. 

Instead, we use the Year 2000 Standard Million age distribution to re-weight the
age specific rates in order to calculate age standardized rates. Again, this is like
controlling for age and saying "what rate would we have observed if the age distribution 
had been as in the Year 2000 Standard Million?"

One we have our age-standardized rates, we can look at those and see that there's a roughly 
2.15x rate ratio in premature mortality between the highest poverty areas and lowest
poverty areas.

## Non-Spatial Regression 

:::{style='font-size: 24px'}
  - Modern epidemiologists and statisticians might be inclined to 
  take a <span style='color: #eb4d4b'>**regression approach**</span> to estimation of inequities. 
  - This permits statistical adjustment for multiple covariates (not just age)
  - Typically we model age-specific disease rates using a log-linear
  Poisson model as follows: 
  $$Y_{ij} \sim \text{Poisson}(\mu_{ij})$$
  $$\text{log}(\mu_{ij}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + ... + \beta_p x_p + \log(n_{ij})$$
  where $Y_{ij}$ is the observed count in area $i$, covariate stratum $j$ and $n_{ij}$ is the population person-time that gave rise to the
  observed count. 
  - This yields $\hat \beta$ estimates that are interpretable as 
  <span style='color: #eb4d4b'>**log incidence rate ratios**</span> 
  (exponentiate to transform them back to the rate ratio scale).
:::

:::{.notes}
The aggregate method does satisfy some needs, and we can perform age standardization with it, 
but things would certainly get tricky if we wanted to incorporate multiple area based social metrics. 

Instead, a more comprehensive framework is to use regression. 

What's crucial in epidemiology when we're dealing with discrete health outcome events is that
we use a count-based model.  

We again have to be careful to specify the amount of person-time during which events
can occur. 

These will allow us to adjust for age, modeling rate ratios for each age strata.

I just want to point out that Poisson regression models are a bit of an old stand-by, but there
are others models that more flexibly allow for overdispersion, namely the Quasi-Poisson and Negative Binomial models, but I don't think I have time today to get into those. 

This is a nice approach for understanding systematic variations and co-variations
between area-based social metrics, risk factors, and health outcomes. 
:::

## Non-Spatial Regression

<img src="images/02_methods/poisson2.png" style='position: absolute;'>

:::{.notes}
[walk through the slide]

To interpret these results, besides needing to exponentiate them first, 
I want to note that these are rate ratios in reference to the 
reference level defined in each of the factor variables.

So for example, we can interpret these results as telling us that
there was a 2.18 times higher premature mortality rate in census tracts
with 20-100% poverty rates as compared to the premature mortality 
in census tracts with 0-5% poverty rates while also adjusting for age.

  $$U_i | U_{j, j \neq i} \sim \text{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma_U^2 / n_i)$$

:::{.notes}
One of the sources of variation we haven't yet addressed is spatial autocorrelation, 
or the tendencies of neighboring areas' outcomes to be correlated.

There are many models that account for spatial autocorrelation including those
proposed by Besag, York and Mollié, the Leroux model, and others — but the idea
central to all of them is that we need to be explicit about modeling spatial
structure and spatial interdependence in our data.

Here, the BYM model is saying that the area level rates should be a function of
the average of their neighboring area's rates, randomness, and other predictors.

  such presentations can create or reinforce <span style='color: #eb4d4b'>territorial stigmatization</span> where places are

more programmatic capacity who would be focused on the hands-on data analysis,
the coding, and the technical details of the work.

We strongly emphasized throughout that it's absolutely appropriate to pick your
battles and to be honest about where the greatest bang-for-your-buck would be 
in terms of effort spent and payoff.

:::{.notes}
I want to conclude with this slide from Nancy Krieger. 

As you will see, Social Justice and Public Health are twin pillars of ecosocial theory. 

The point of analyzing how injustices such as structural racism or any other
harm health is not to prove that they are wrong, since they are definitionally
unjust, but rather to do correct science and to generate publicly testable and
tested actionable knowledge about who is bearing the burden of exposure to
disease, illness, and death.

The point is not to do so-called politically correct science, but rather to do
correct science that rigorously addresses the causal mechanisms, complex social
pathways, and spatiotemporal realities of how health inequities are perpetuated
and, conversely, how they can be ended.

We hope that you will take advantage of the resources we have collated for you,
and that you will continue asking the hard questions of who must do what, in
collaboration with whom, in order to advance health justice given the new
knowledge that can be generated using the methods presented here and otherwise.
